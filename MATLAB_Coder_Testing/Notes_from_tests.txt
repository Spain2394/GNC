Notes from testing Matlab coder with a toy example
===================================================

The C code and MATLAB code return the same results for the test function.

The C code generated is very verbose, particularly for the backslash operator (solving linear systems)
It might be a good idea to wrap this inside another function.
This function will be included in the MATLAB code gen and will hopefully abstract away
the large amount of code behind solving linear systems.

eg. function [x] = solveLinearSys(A, X)
		x = A\b;


There are a lot of headers and source files when generating the code but this is more
of a book keeping issue as the actual file sizes aren't large.
