CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/pdetr/Documents/Stanford/Year 2/AA 236A/GNC/cmake_build_debug/_deps/pybind11-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/Ethan/CLionProjects/GNC/cmake_build_debug/_deps/pybind11-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
