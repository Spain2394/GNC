Draw block diagram for control system -> python and C interfaces
Simulink cholesky block

MATLAB
===============
Pass inertia as parameter

Debug current implementation

Read paper - add control limits, regularization

Add check / failure condition for if max iterations exceeded
Re-write satelltie dynamics in simplest way (expand matrices)

Change backslash to Cholesky (if needed)
Add control limits
Add magnetorquer control / magnetic field model

Make cholesky solver for iLQR and MEKF

C
===========
compile pendulum iLQR
