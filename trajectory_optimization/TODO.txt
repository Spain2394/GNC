Check/swap signs of K and l


Pass inertia (and it's inverse) as parameters
Magnetic field model (pass in time sequence of B vectors) calls IGRF & sgp4


Read paper - add: 
 -> control limits (boxQP)
 -> regularization for backward pass
 -> better line search
 -> Failure criteria (max iterations, )


Read Zac's paper:
Add magnetorquer control / magnetic field model
	Should pre-compute orbit and magnetic field in ECI or ECEF
	Pass in time series of B vectors to iLQR
	Convert the B vector to Body frame for calculating torque at each step
	

Add check after solver has run that final attitude and velocity are
within an acceptable tolerance of the desired values. If not
don't run the control sequence
