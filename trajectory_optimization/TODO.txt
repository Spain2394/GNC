Draw block diagram for control system -> python and C interfaces


MATLAB
===============
Read paper - add control limits, regularization

Add check / failure condition for if max iterations exceeded
Re-write satelltie dynamics in simplest way (expand matrices)

Change backslash to Cholesky (if needed)
Add control limits
Add magnetorquer control / magnetic field model

C
===========
compile pendulum iLQR
write Linear algebra functions for iLQR and MEKF
