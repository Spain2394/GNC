Structure
============
Draw block diagram for control system -> python and C interfaces
Pass inertia (and it's inverse) as parameters
Magnetic field model (make accessible in the function) calls IGRF


Debug current implementation
Read paper - add control limits, regularization


Add check / failure condition for if max iterations exceeded

Make cholesky solver for iLQR and MEKF  (maybe Simulink cholesky block)
Change backslash to call to Cholesky solver
Add control limits


Add magnetorquer control / magnetic field model
	Should pre-compute orbit and magnetic field in ECI or ECEF
	Pass in time series of B vectors to iLQR
	Convert the B vector to Body frame for calculating torque at each step
