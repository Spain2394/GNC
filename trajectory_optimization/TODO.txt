Immediate
================
- Fix floating point issue in single precision C code...Doesn't converge/work at all
	Works exactly the same as MATLAB when coded with double precision

- Write controllability grammian solver in python (needs SGP4)

- Write script to test magnetorquer control (possibly use python and call C code with ctypes library)

- Tune cost params

- !!! Try to run MILQR in circuitpython on the board!!!


Pass parameters
==================
- Inertia and it's inverse
- Solver Options - need to decide which ones to hardcode (if any)
- Cost function matrices (Maybe?)

- Add functionality for different length trajectories (just pass N as parameter)


Hardware
====================
-Write magentorquer inversion code that converts a magnetic moment vector
 in the body frame to commands for each of the 6 coils on the satellite

 Python
 ===================
Main control loop:

-Call controllability algorithm {
	loop:
		until controllabiltiy found or max time surpassed
		-Call SGP4 (starting a few minutes in the future) to find a future satellite state (in ECI)
		-Call IGRF to get the Earth magnetic field (B vector) in ECEF for that state.
		-Convert the B vector to ECI
		-Add new B vector to the controllability grammian
		-Check for controllability
		-Add the B-vector to an array
	}

-If failed ??
-If succeeded:
	-Call MILQR with the B-vector array
		-Add check after solver runs that final attitude and velocity are within an acceptable tolerance (can do in MATLAB/C)

-If MILQR succeeds, wait until start time
-Call main control loop
	-Measure
	-Interpolate controls based on state measurement
	-Actuate
