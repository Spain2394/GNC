CPP
===============

>>>
Get the current implementation to compile
Sort alternative to passing matrix slices by non-const reference into rkstep integration function
(and anywhere else where passing Matrices is causing issues)

>>>
Make sure all matrices are allocted at compile time
(use Matrix<type, rows, cols> initalization form the base class)
Currently the iLQR function creates several matrices internally, need to pass these in to the function pre-allocated.
This could entail passing a block of memory (as a large array/matrix) into the function, then mapping it into useful
smaller matrices using the Eigen::Map function 

>>>
Implement the dynamics directly in the rkstep function

>>>
Make adjustments for quaternions/ satellite dynamics

>>>
Add check to ensure cholesky decomposition remains stable in backward pass (Matrix is positive definite)


Python
==================

>>>
Finish writing a python implementation of iLQR
Use the python implementation (as well as other python scripts) to test each section of the C++ implementation (Pybind)
