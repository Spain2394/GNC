- Check boolean type circuit python (needs boolean header)
- Check variable sized arrays (needs C99 compiler)
- Linker script (with stack size): /home/nick/Documents/AA236/circuitpython/ports/atmel-samd/asf4/samd51/gcc/gcc
	> Default: 0xC000 = 44 KB (1000 = 4 KB, C-1 = 11, 11*4 = 44 KB)

- Try make x0 a single column rather than an entire time history.
- Check floats work okay (instead of doubles)
- Try to remove large/small constants in auto generated code (maybe include NaN types)


// Pass parameters
==================
- Inertia and it's inverse
- Solver Options.
- Magnetic field trajectory (pass in time sequence of B vectors) calls IGRF & sgp4
- Cost function matrices (Maybe?)


Read Zac's paper:
Add magnetorquer control / magnetic field model
	Should pre-compute orbit and magnetic field in ECI or ECEF
	Pass in time series of B vectors to iLQR
	Convert the B vector to Body frame for calculating torque at each step
	
Add functionality for different length trajectories (just pass N as parameter)

Add check (in python?) after solver has run that final attitude and velocity are
within an acceptable tolerance of the desired values. If not don't run the control sequence
