QPsolver -> check if auto coder can handle boolean array multiplciation (clamped gradient)

Make stripped down version for Auto-Coder
Auto Code for hardware run


Pass inertia (and it's inverse) as parameters
Magnetic field model (pass in time sequence of B vectors) calls IGRF & sgp4


Read Zac's paper:
Add magnetorquer control / magnetic field model
	Should pre-compute orbit and magnetic field in ECI or ECEF
	Pass in time series of B vectors to iLQR
	Convert the B vector to Body frame for calculating torque at each step
	

Add check (in python?) after solver has run that final attitude and velocity are
within an acceptable tolerance of the desired values. If not
don't run the control sequence


Add functionality in C-code for different length trajectories
