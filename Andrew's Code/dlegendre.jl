    function dlegendre!([N,] dP::Matrix, ϕ::Number, P::Matrix, ph_term::Bool = false)

Compute the first-order derivative of the associated Legendre function
`P_n,m[x]` w.r.t. `ϕ` [rad]:

    dP_n,m[cos(ϕ)]
    --------------
          dϕ

The derivatives will be stored in the matrix `dP`. Hence, the maximum degree and
order that will be computed are given by the dimensions of this matrix. Notice,
however, that `dP` must be a square matrix.

This algorithm needs the matrix `P` with the associated Legendre function. This
can be computed using the function `legendre`. Notice that this matrix must be
computed using the same normalization (see `N`) as the one selected here.

The optional parameter `N` can be used to select the normalization. The
following values are valid:

* `Val{:full}`: Compute the fully normalized associated Legendre function (see
                `dlegendre_fully_normalized!`).
* `Val{:schmidt}`: Compute the Schmidt quasi-normalized associated Legendre
                   function (see `dlegendre_schmidt_quasi_normalized!`).
* `Val{:conv}`: Compute the conventional associated Legendre function (see
                `dlegendre_conventional!`).

If `N` is omitted, then the full normalization will be used (`Val{:full}`).

If `ph_term` is set to `true`, then the Condon-Shortley phase term `(-1)ᵐ` will
be included. If `ph_term` is not present, then it defaults to `false`.

"""
    function dlegendre_conventional(ϕ::Number, P::Matrix, ph_term = false)

Compute the first-order derivative of the conventional associated Legendre
function `P_n,m[cos(ϕ)]` w.r.t. `ϕ` [rad]:

    dP_n,m[cos(ϕ)]
    --------------
          dϕ

This algorithm needs the matrix `P` with the conventional associated Legendre
function. This can be computed using the function
`legendre_schmidt_quasi_normalized`. The maximum order of the computed
derivatives will be selected according to the dimensions of the matrix `P`.

If `ph_term` is set to `true`, then the Condon-Shortley phase term `(-1)ᵐ` will
be included. If `ph_term` is not present, then it defaults to `false`.

# Returns

A matrix with the first-order derivative of the Legendre associated functions
`P_n,m[cos(ϕ)]`.

# Remarks

The user is responsible to pass a matrix `P` with the correct values. For
example, if `ph_term` is `true`, then `P` must also be computed with `ph_term`
set to `true`.
